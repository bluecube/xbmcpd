# Configuration

File settings.py contains the parameters for xbmcPD to connect to the XBMC
instance's httpapi (XBMC_HOST and XBMC_PORT) and the optional credentials
(XBMC_USER and XBMC_PASS). The port to expose the MPD API for MPD clients is
configured in the same file (MPD_PORT).

# Running

Once configured, xbmcpd.py can be run (through Python), to start the wrapper.
